title: Clipboard browser E2E capstone — scripted copy via clipboard read, 1 MB paste sha256

## Goal
End-to-end browser proof of the clipboard flow against a real guest: a scripted guest `printf` of an
OSC 52 sequence is asserted via a host clipboard read, and a scripted 1 MB paste into `cat > file` is
asserted byte-identical by guest sha256.

## Context
Split from **E3-T22**. The browser-integration capstone over the deterministic E3-T22a (copy) and
E3-T22b (paste) cores. Playwright + Clipboard API permissions; runtime-agnostic parts proven on the
fast busybox guest per the reaping constraint.

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] Scripted guest OSC 52 copy asserted via `navigator.clipboard.readText()` (or the confirm flow).
- [ ] 1 MB paste into `cat > /root/paste.txt` yields a byte-identical file (sha256), no dropped or
  reordered chunks.
- [ ] Multi-line paste with bracketed paste on executes zero commands until Enter.
